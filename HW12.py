#1. Print Hello World!

print("Hello World")

#2. Create three different boolean variables named wifi, login, and admin.

wifi = True
login = True
Admin = True

#3. Create a separate integer variable that denotes the number of times
#someone with admin credentials has logged in.

log_in_int = 1

#4. Create a nested if statement that checks to see if wifi is true,
#login is true, and admin is true. If they are all true, print a
#welcome message and increase the integer variable by one. If one of them
#is false, print an error message telling them which one they are "missing".
